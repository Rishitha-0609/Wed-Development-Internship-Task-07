### Fetch and Display Public API Data
This project is a simple web application that demonstrates how to fetch, parse, and display data from a public API using the JavaScript Fetch API with async/await. 
It retrieves user data from the JSONPlaceholder API and presents it in a clean, responsive card layout.

### Features
--> Fetch User Data: Dynamically fetches a list of users from a remote API.
-->Dynamic Display: Renders the fetched user data (name, email, and address) into individual cards.
-->Responsive Design: The user card layout adapts to different screen sizes.
-->Loading State: Displays a "Loading..." message while the data is being fetched.
-->Error Handling: Gracefully handles network errors and displays a user-friendly error message.
-->Reload Functionality: Includes a "Reload Data" button to re-fetch the data.
